    <h1>My Perfect Doggy</h1>

    <p>My doggy is called Tom and he's a black German Shepard. At 6 years old, he's quite big but still loves to play as if he was a small puppy. Some of his favorite activities include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Going for walks</li>
      <li>Sleeping</li>
      <li>Eating</li>
    </ul>
